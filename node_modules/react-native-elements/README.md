## RNE Ecosystem:

React Native Elements also serves as a **platform** that connects **small
teams/individuals** that needs help developing their RN app with **open source
contributors** that are willing to **build complex UI screens & animated
interactions** for ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°.

Here are some of the screens that our developers have created so far:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 50px">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702785-b1d9114e-c7a0-11e7-9999-6c6a00d432ec.gif" width="280" />
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702789-b6bbdce6-c7a0-11e7-8034-8144274fbdae.gif" width="280" />
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7840686/32702791-b947eedc-c7a0-11e7-8e8c-7dff1bd80564.gif" width="280" />
</div>
<br /><br />

If this sounds interesting and you would like to participate, kindly open a
**new issue with the design & spec of the UI screen** that you need to be
developed. One of our developers will respond to your issue with an estimate of
time & cost.

It's built on top of **RNE & Open Collective**. If you have any feedback or
would like to know more details about this kindly contact
**[Monte Thakkar](https://github.com/Monte9)**.

## React Native Web support

As a cross platform UI Toolkit, you can now use RNE on the web & share your codebase between your React Native + React web apps. RNE components are rendered perfectly on browser. You can achieve this to target iOS, Android and Web by collaborating RNE and [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

Click [here](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/blog/2018/12/13/react-native-web.html) for a full walkthrough using React Native Elements + React Native Web.

## Expo Demo App

Checkout the official
[React Native Elements App](https://expo.io/@monte9/react-native-elements-app)
on Expo which uses all of the React Native Elements components.

If you are looking to contribute to the React Native Elements App, click
[here](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements-app) to
view the implementation & run the RNE expo app locally.
