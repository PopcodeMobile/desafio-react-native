> React Native Elements has UI elements that are easy to use & really customizable. It also has theming, platform specific search bars, [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) support, and much more.

It's finally here! Let's put our hands together and welcome React Native Elements 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

This release is centered around making RNE components that everyone loves more intuitive to use & stable. This is not to say that all the work is done, but this is definitely a giant leap in the right direction and one that we have been working on for over a year.

I want like to say thank you to our users for using RNE and giving us feedback through issues on the repo and also the contributors who have the taken time to contribute and help improve RNE together. Finally, I'd like to say a big thanks to [Kyle Roach](https://twitter.com/roach_iam) and [Xavier VillelÃ©gier](https://twitter.com/xaviervllgr) without whom this project would not have been as awesome as it is today!!

This blog post is meant to serve as a migration guide for upgrading to `react-native-elements: "^1.0.0"` from `0.19.1` and also a way to document and share all the breaking changes, new features and other improvements in this release. For those updating from `1.0.0-beta7` you can view those release notes [here](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

The wait is over!! Get excited, cause we certainly are. 14K ðŸŒŸ and counting...

## Installation

```

### `Avatar`

- Props `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge` have been removed. Usage is now `size="small"` etc. [#1098](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1098)

### `Badge`

- `wrapperStyle` prop has been removed - use `containerStyle` prop instead ([#1545](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1545))
- `badgeStyle` prop replaces previous behaviour of `containerStyle` prop ([#1545](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1545))
- `element` prop which was undocumented is removed - use `value` prop instead ([#1545](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1545))
- can no longer render children - instead use `value` prop which now supports rendering react components ([#1545](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1545))

### `Button`

- By default on Android there's no more elevation ([#1538](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1538)). To get elevation, use the `raised` prop.
- Renamed `textStyle` to `titleStyle`
- Renamed `containerViewStyle` to `containerStyle`
- Removed props `transparent` and `outline` ([#1540](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1540)). Instead use the `type` prop.

```jsx
// Transparent
<Button type="clear" />

// Outline
<Button type="outline" />
```

- Removed props `secondary`, `secondary2`, `secondary3`, `primary1`, `primary2`, `backgroundColor`. Use the `buttonStyle` prop to set the background color.
- Removed `iconComponent` prop. If you want to use a different Icon component - the `icon` prop supports custom elements.
- Removed `loadingRight` prop. Loading indicator **displays without title**. May re-add in future.
- Removed `borderRadius` prop. To control the border radius use the `buttonStyle` prop.
- Removed props `color`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, and `fontFamily`. Instead use the `titleStyle` prop to set attributes for the title.
- Removed `large` prop. May re-add in future.

### `ButtonGroup`

- `disableSelected` prop has been removed ([#1587](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1587))

### `Card`

- `fontFamily` prop is deprecated - instead use `titleStyle` prop ([#1659](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1587))
- `flexDirection` prop is deprecated - instead use `wrapperStyle` prop ([#1659](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1587))

### `Form`

- `FormInput` been renamed to `Input` ([#497](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/497))

  - `clearText` method renamed to `clear`
  - `textInputRef` and `containerRef` props removed
  - `normalizeFontSize` prop removed. You can use the `normalize` helper along with the `inputStyle` prop to normalize font sizes.

- `FormLabel` has been removed. This is now built into the `Input` component by use of `label` prop. Props `labelStyle` and `labelProps` can be used to customize it.
- `FormValidationMessage` has been removed. This is now built into the `Input` component by use of `errorMessage` prop. Props `errorStyle` and `errorProps` can be used to customize it.

### `Header`

- Props `innerContainerStyles`, `outerContainerStyles` removed [#1221](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1221). Instead use the `containerStyle` prop for main styling, along with props `leftContainerStyle`, `centerContainerStyle`, and `rightContainerStyle` when needed.

### `SearchBar`

SearchBar now supports different platform styles! To get an iOS or Android themed SearchBar, use the `platform` prop. `platform="ios"` or `platform="android"`

- `noIcon` prop removed. Instead to remove the search icon use the `searchIcon` prop. E.g `searchIcon={null}`
- `showLoadingIcon` prop renamed to `showLoading` [#837](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/837)
- `containerRef` prop removed

### `List`

- **`List` component has been removed!** `List` was just a regular React Native View with some small margin styles. It wasn't actually needed to use the `ListItem` component. Instead we recommend using the [`FlatList`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist) or [`SectionList`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/sectionlist) components from React Native which function both as Views and also displaying items, pull to refresh and more.
- If you want to apply the same styles that the `List` component provided prior to 1.0, [see this comment](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/issues/1565#issuecomment-436982251).

### `ListItem`

- `leftIconOnPress`, `leftIconOnLongPress`, `leftIconUnderlayColor`, and `leftIconContainerStyle`, removed. The `leftIcon` prop can accept props.

```jsx
<ListItem
  title="Yea"
  leftIcon={{ name: 'home', onPress: () => alert('hello') }}
/>
```

- `avatar`, `avatarStyle`, `avatarContainerStyle`, `roundAvatar`, and `avatarOverlayContainerStyle` removed. Avatars can now be customized using the `rightAvatar` and `leftAvatar` props which can either render a custom element or an object that describes the props from Avatar.

```jsx
<ListItem
  leftAvatar={{
    title: 'MD',
    rounded: false,
    containerStyle: { margin: 5 },
    onPress: () => alert('hey'),
  }}
  rightAvatar={{ title: 'DW', onLongPress: () => alert('hey') }}
/>
```

- `wrapperStyle` prop removed. Use the `containerStyle` prop instead.
- `titleNumberOfLines`, `subtitleNumberOfLines`, and `rightTitleNumberOfLines` props removed. Use the `titleProps`, `rightTitleProps`, and `subtitleProps` props to pass props for each..

```jsx
<ListItem titleProps={{ numberOfLines: 4 }} />
```

- `hideChevron` removed. Use the `chevron` prop instead. However, the behaviour is swapped `hideChevron={true}` behaves like `chevron={false}`
- `chevronColor` removed. The `chevron` prop now can accept an object describing it's appearance.

```jsx
<ListItem chevron={{ color: 'pink' }} />
```

- `fontFamily` removed. Use the `titleStyle` and `subTitleStyle` props to set change the text styling
- `titleContainerStyle` removed. Use the `titleStyle` prop instead.
- `rightTitleContainerStyle` removed. Use the `rightTitleStyle` prop instead.
- `subtitleContainerStyle` removed. Use the `subtitleStyle` prop instead.
- `label` prop removed.
- `switchButton`, `onSwitch`, `switchDisabled`, `switchOnTintColor`, `switchThumbTintColor`, `switchTintColor`, and `switched` removed. Instead use the `switch` prop wich accepts an object describing its props.
- `textInput`,`textInputAutoCapitalize`,`textInputAutoCorrect`,`textInputAutoFocus`,`textInputEditable`,`textInputKeyboardType`,`textInputMaxLength`,`textInputMultiline`,`textInputOnChangeText`,`textInputOnFocus`,`textInputOnBlur`,`textInputSelectTextOnFocus`,`textInputReturnKeyType`,`textInputValue`,`textInputSecure`,`textInputStyle`,`textInputContainerStyle`,`textInputPlaceholder` removed. We now expose a single `input` prop which accepts an object describing its props.
- `onPressRightIcon` removed. Use the `rightIcon` prop which can accept an object now describing its props.

```jsx
<ListItem rightIcon={{ name: 'home', onPress: () => console.log('clicked') }} />
```

### `PricingCard`

- `titleFont` removed. Use the `titleStyle` prop instead to customize the title. [#1231](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1231)
- `pricingFont` removed. Use the `pricingStyle` prop instead to customize the price. [#1231](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1231)
- `infoFont` removed. Use the `infoStyle` prop instead to customize the info. [#1231](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1231)

```jsx
<PricingCard button={{ buttonStyle: { fontFamily: 'Arial' } }} />
```

### `Text`

- `fontFamily` prop is removed - instead use `style` prop ([#1659](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements/pull/1587))
