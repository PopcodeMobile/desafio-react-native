## Router:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `backAndroidHandler`     | `Function` |  | Allows custom control of hardwareBackPress in Android (optional). For more info check [BackHandler](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/backhandler.html).  |
| `children` |  | semi-required | Scene root element (required if `navigator` is not set) |
| `navigator`   | `Class` |  | Application navigator with all Scenes created by `Actions.create` - it is altenative way to create Router, mostly used for Redux integration (see ReduxExample for more details) |
| `onStateChange`   | `Function` |  | function to be called every time when navigation state is changed. Useful for mobx stores to change observables (set scene to `Actions.currentScene`, etc.) |
| `sceneStyle`     | `Style` |  | Style applied to all scenes (optional) |
| `uriPrefix`     | `string` |  | A uri prefix to strip from incoming urls for deep linking. For example, if you wanted to support deep linking from `www.example.com/user/1234/`, then you could pass `example.com` to only match paths against `/user/1234/`. |
| `wrapBy`   | `Function` |  | function to wrap each Scene component and nav bar buttons - allows easy MobX integration (by passing `observer`) |

## Scene:
The basic routing component for this router, all `<Scene>` components require a `key` prop that must be unique. A parent `<Scene>` must have a `component` as a `prop` as it will act as a grouping component for its children.

All properties of type `React.Component` will receive the same properties available on the Scene.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `key`       | `string` | `required` | Will be used to call screen transition, for example, `Actions.name(params)`. Must be unique. |
| `path`       | `string` |  | Will be used to match against incoming deep links and pull params. For example, the path `/user/:id/` would specify to call the Scene's action with params `{ id: 1234 }` from the url `/user/1234/`. Should adhere to widely accepted uri templating standard https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570 |
| `component` | `React.Component` | `semi-required` | The `Component` to be displayed. Not required when defining a nested `Scene`, see example. |

## Stack (`<Stack>`)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |

| `hideDrawerButton` | `boolean` | `false` | Boolean to show or not the drawerImage or drawerIcon |


## Modals (`<Modal>` or `<Scene modal>`)
To implement a modal, you must use `<Modal>` as the root scene in your `Router`. The `Modal` will render the first scene (should be your true root scene) normally, and all following
To display a modal use `<Modal>` as root renderer, so it will render the first element as `normal` scene and all others as popups (when they are pushed).

Example:
In the example below, the `root` Scene is nested within a `<Modal>`, since it is the first nested `Scene`, it will render normally. If one were to `push` to `statusModal`, `errorModal` or `loginModal`, they will render as a `Modal` and by default will pull up from the bottom of the screen. It is important to note that currently the `Modal` does not allow for transparent backgrounds.

```jsx
//... import components
<Router>
  <Modal>
    <Scene key="root">
      <Scene key="screen1" initial={true} component={Screen1} />
      <Scene key="screen2" component={Screen2} />
    </Scene>
    <Scene key="statusModal" component={StatusModal} />
    <Scene key="errorModal" component={ErrorModal} />
    <Scene key="loginModal" component={LoginModal} />
  </Modal>
</Router>
```

## Lightbox (`<Lightbox>`)
Lightbox is a component used to render a component on top of the current `Scene`. Unlike modal, it will allow for resizing and transparency of the background.

Example:
In the example below, the `root` Scene is nested within a `<Lightbox>`, since it is the first nested `Scene`, it will render normally. If one were to `push` to `loginLightbox`, they will render as a `Lightbox` and by default will lay on top of the current `Scene` allowing for transparent backrounds.

```jsx
//... import components
<Router>
  <Lightbox>
    <Scene key="root">
      <Scene key="screen1" initial={true} component={Screen1} />
      <Scene key="screen2" component={Screen2} />
    </Scene>

    {/* Lightbox components will lay over the screen, allowing transparency*/}
    <Scene key="loginLightbox" component={loginLightbox} />
  </Lightbox>
</Router>
```

## Actions
This `Object` is the main utility is to provide navigation features to your application. Assuming your `Router` and `Scenes` are configured properly, use the properties listed below to navigate between scenes. Some offer the added functionality to pass React `props` to the navigated scene.

These can be used directly, for example, `Actions.pop()` will dispatch correspond action written in the source code, or, you can set those constants in scene type, when you do Actions.main(), it will dispatch action according to your scene type or the default one.

| Property | Type | Parameters | Description |
|-----------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `[key]` | `Function` | `Object` | The `Actions` object "automagically" uses the `Scene`'s `key` prop in the `Router` to navigate. To navigate to a scene, call `Actions.key()` or `Actions[key].call()`. |
| `create` | `React.Element` | pass `Scene` to create your app navigator. It is alternative router creation method mostly used for Redux integration |
| `currentScene` | `String` | | Returns the current scene that is active |
| `drawerClose` | `Function` | | Closes the `Drawer` if applicable |
| `drawerOpen` | `Function` | | Opens the `Drawer` if applicable |
| `jump` | `Function` | `(sceneKey: String, props: Object)` | used to switch to a new tab. For `Tabs` only. |
| `pop` | `Function` | | Go back to the previous scene by "popping" the current scene off the nav stack |
| `popTo` | `Function` | `(sceneKey: String, props: Object)` | Pops the navigation stack until the `Scene` with the specified key is reached. |
| `push` | `Function` | `(sceneKey: String, props: Object)` | Pushes the scene to the stack, performing a transition to the new scene. |
| `refresh` | `Function` | `(props: Object)` | Reloads the current scene by loading new `props` into the `Scene` |
| `replace` | `Function` | `(sceneKey: String, props: Object)` |  Pops the current scene from the stack and pushes the new scene to the navigation stack. *No transition will occur. |
| `reset` | `Function` | `(sceneKey: String, props: Object)` | Clears the routing stack and pushes the scene into the first index. *No transition will occur.* |

## ActionConst
Type constants to determine `Scene` transitions, These are **PREFERRED** over typing their values manually as these are subject to change as the project is updated.

| Property | Type | Value | Shorthand |
|-----------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `ActionConst.ANDROID_BACK` | `string` | 'REACT_NATIVE_ROUTER_FLUX_ANDROID_BACK' | *N/A* |

| `ActionConst.BACK` | `string` | 'REACT_NATIVE_ROUTER_FLUX_BACK' | `pop` |
| `ActionConst.BLUR` | `string` | 'REACT_NATIVE_ROUTER_FLUX_BLUR' | *N/A* |

| `ActionConst.PUSH` | `string` | 'REACT_NATIVE_ROUTER_FLUX_PUSH' | `push` |
| `ActionConst.REFRESH` | `string` | 'REACT_NATIVE_ROUTER_FLUX_REFRESH' | `refresh` |

| `ActionConst.RESET` | `string` | 'REACT_NATIVE_ROUTER_FLUX_RESET' | `reset` |

## Universal and Deep Linking
#### Use Case
- Consider a web app and mobile app pairing for a social network, which might have a url `https://thesocialnetwork.com/profile/1234/`.
- If we were building both a web app and a mobile app, we'd like to be able to express that uri scheme across platforms with the path `/profile/:id/`.
- On the web, we might want `React-Router` to to open up our `<Profile />` component with the `props` `{ id: 1234 }`.
- On mobile, if we've correctly set up our Android/iOS environment to launch our application and open our RNRF `<Router />`, then we also want to navigate to our mobile `<Profile />` scene with the `params` ` { id: 1234 }`

#### Usage
```javascript
<Router uriPrefix={'thesocialnetwork.com'}>
  <Scene key="root">
     <Scene key={'home'} component={Home} />
     <Scene key={'profile'} path={"/profile/:id/"} component={Profile} />
     <Scene key={'profileForm'} path={"/edit/profile/:id/"} component={ProfileForm} />
  </Scene>
</Router>
```

If a user clicks on `http://thesocialnetwork.com/profile/1234/` on their device, they'll open the `<Router />` and then call `Actions.profile({ id: 1234 })`
