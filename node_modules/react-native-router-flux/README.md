`react-native-router-flux` is a different API over `react-navigation`. It helps users to define all the routes in one central place and navigate and communicate between different screens in an easy way. But it also means that `react-native-router-flux` inherits all [limitations](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/limitations.html) and changes from updated versions.

### IMPORTANT NOTES

#### v4 is based on [React Navigation v2.x](https://reactnavigation.org/). See [this branch](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/tree/v3) and [docs](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/blob/master/README3.md) for v3 based on deprecated React Native Experimental Navigation API. It is not supported and may not work with latest React Native versions.

#### v4.0.0-beta.x is based on [React Navigation v1.5.x](https://reactnavigation.org/). See [this branch](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/tree/v4.0.0-beta) for this version. It is also not supported and may not work with the latest React Native versions.

## Usage

Define all your routes in one React component...

```js
const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Stack key="root">
      <Scene key="login" component={Login} title="Login"/>
      <Scene key="register" component={Register} title="Register"/>
      <Scene key="home" component={Home}/>
    </Stack>
  </Router>
);
```

...and navigate from one scene to another scene with a simple and powerful API.

```js
// Login.js

// navigate to 'home' as defined in your top-level router
Actions.home(PARAMS)

// go back (i.e. pop the current screen off the nav stack)
Actions.pop()

// refresh the current Scene with the specified props
Actions.refresh({param1: 'hello', param2: 'world'})
```

# Run it
yarn start
```

## v4 Features
* Based on latest [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) API
* Separate navigation logic from presentation. You may now change navigation state directly from your business logic code - stores/reducers/etc. navigationStore
* Built-in state machine (v3 `Switch` replacement)
  * Each `Scene` with `component` defined can have `onEnter`/`onExit`/`on` handlers.
  * `onEnter`/`on` handler can be async.
  * For 'truthy' return of `onEnter`/`on`, `success` handler (if defined) will be executed
    * if `success` is a string then router will navigate to the `Scene` with that key
  * in case of handler's failure, `failure` prop (if defined) will be run.
  * Combining `onEnter`, `onExit`, `success`, and `failure` makes patterns like authentication, data validation, and conditional transitions simple and intuitive.
* [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)-friendly: all scenes are wrapped with `observer`. You may subscribe to `navigationStore` (`Actions` in v3) and observe current navigation state. Not applicable to Redux.
* Flexible Nav bar customization, currently not allowed by React Navigation:
https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/779
* Drawer support (provided by React Navigation)
* Inheritance of scene attributes allow you to avoid any code/attribute duplications. Adding `rightTitle` to a scene will apply to all child scenes simultaneously. See example app.
* Access to your app navigations state as simple as `Actions.state`.
* Use `Actions.currentScene` to get name of current scene.
